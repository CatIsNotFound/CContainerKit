# CContainerKit

A collection of extended C container libraries based on the C11 standard, including common data structures such as static arrays, dynamic arrays, stacks, queues, dynamic linked lists, and general binary trees. Suitable for beginners learning C/C++.

This library is a personal project for learning data structures and may have problems and shortcomings.

The author welcomes you to ask questions or provide suggestions in [Discussions](https://github.com/CatIsNotFound/CContainerKit/discussions) or [Issues](https://github.com/CatIsNotFound/CContainerKit/issues) to help improve this project.

## Features

- C extension library with C11 support.
- Various container implementations are provided, such as static arrays, dynamic arrays, stacks, queues, etc.
- Support storage and manipulation of variables of any type.
